# Inspiration Station
This is an API that does serverside rendering to return a random inspirational quote paired with an image. 
You will be able to keep getting random quotes until you find one you like.


You can switch out the quotes and the images independently.

#### Future Feature
Connecting to Instagram to do a direct post. Currently to keep the iage you 
have to do a screen shot.
